        <p> The Last of Us Part 2 is first and foremost a tale of revenge.<br>
            Our teenage heroine Ellie's surrogate father Joel is viciously<br>
            murdered and we must avenge him. It's a simple premise on its <br>
            surface. How many stories have we seen where someone's family <br>
            member is murdered and they go off on a quest for vengeance? <br>
            And typically these premises can fall a bit flat emotionally, <br>
            as there isn't enough time to develop the person who gets murdered,<br> 
            so you take the protagonist's word for how indispensable the dead <br>
            person was. <br>
        </p>
        <p> But with The Last of Us Part 1, we've already spent countless<br> 
            hours playing as Joel, fervently undergoing his hardships over <br>
            the course of the first game -- as well as the opening of this <br>
            second act. We as players have been waiting eight years to spend <br>
            more time with Joel, to hear more of his story and follow his <br>
            character arc -- especially to see how his relationship with <br>
            Ellie has grown. All the pieces are in place to undergo this new <br>
            journey with him..<br>

        <p> The Last of Us: Part 2 relies so heavily on our emotional<br>
            connection to the characters and events in the first game<br>
            that it would lose the bulk of its impact if you hadn't <br>
            gone through its predecessor in full. <br>
        </p>
        <p> In many ways The Last of Us: Part 2 is among the most brutal, <br>
            nihilistic games ever conceived. It's graphic, violent and angry. <br>
            But it also finds grace in each one of its characters, expertly <br>
            expressing how complex, nuanced, and capable of good everyone can <br>
            be given the right circumstances. By explicitly not giving us what <br>
            we'd want from a sequel, The Last of Us: Part 2 makes us wrestle <br>
            with the power of stories in the first place, and how easy it is <br>
            for them to shape our understanding of who to love, who to hate, <br>
            and what's worth killing over. It's a game that expertly manipulates <br>
            our emotions to explore our ugliest instincts, only to show that we're <br>
            capable of being more than that.<br>

        <p> The Last Of Us Part 2 will take place 5 years after the events<br>
            of the original The Last Of Us, bringing forth new events and <br>
            characters.
            TLOU2 will take place in different areas ranging from lush <br>
            forests to derelict urban centers. This will give us more <br>
            information about the game's world, lore, and the characters <br>
            that live in it. <br>
        </p>
        <p> In the The Last Of Us 2, you as a protagonist will be taking <br>
            control of Ellie, albeit more mature and grizzled from surviving <br>
            the end of the world events from her last venture. <br>
            The intense combat system from the original The Last Of Us have <br>
            received a major overhaul in this iteration. From dodges and healing <br>
            your wounds, character's action have been tailor made to adjust with <br>
            the situation and weapon that Ellie may use. <br>
        </p>
        <p> Along with new actions such as crawling in tight spaces for stealth, <br>
            pulling out arrow shrapnel, the 'listening' function makes a return <br>
            to this as well. Ellie can listen in on the noises made to spot possible<br> 
            threats. Along with the classic infected and hostile survivors,Ellie will face <br>
            against numerous enemies during her journey. These includes new threats <br>
            such as guard dogs that may quickly chase you down. The enemy AI have also <br>
            received a major update, and will coordinate with their allies and will <br>
            methodically hunt down the intruder.. <br>
